# Dataflow DJ NXG
A port of [Dataflow DJ](https://github.com/dataflowg/dataflow-dj) to LabVIEW NXG.

## Details
This port is an experiment to see how well a small/medium sized project converts to LabVIEW NXG (4.0). The code accompanies [a blog post](https://dataflowg.github.io/Convert-To-LabVIEW-NXG-Part-1/) dicussing the conversion process and details on getting Dataflow DJ working under LabVIEW NXG.

It's largely a proof of concept, and is missing many features present in the LabVIEW 20xx based Dataflow DJ.
